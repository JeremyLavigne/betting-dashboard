                    If you landed here, it probably means you clone the repo on Github, so, letÂ´s say you deserve a
                    little explanation.

                    I like to think that it is possible to bet on football using a magic formula, based on statistics
                    and maths. I searched this formula during a long time, for leasure more than for money.

                    This webpage was made for personnal use, the concept is to open it every morning, see who is playing
                    and where I should bet. Everything behind has been thought, prepared, considered, tested, etc. Only
                    thing to do is follow the app and bet.
                </p>

                    The other purpose is to code and apply coding skills, this app is made with React, Typescript,
                    Webpack.
